		 *
		 * 9. Write a Java program that accepts two integers from the user and then prints the sum, the difference, the product, the average, the distance (the difference between integer), the maximum (the larger of the two integers), the minimum (smaller of the two integers). Go to the editor
		 *
		 * Test Data
		 * Input 1st integer: 25
		 * Input 2nd integer: 5
		 * Expected Output :
		 * Sum of two integers: 30
		 * Difference of two integers: 20
		 * Product of two integers: 125
		 * Average of two integers: 15.00
		 * Distance of two integers: 20
		 * Max integer: 25

		 *
		 * 10. Write a Java program to break an integer into a sequence of individual digits. Go to the editor
		 *
		 * Test Data
		 * Input six non-negative digits: 123456
		 * Expected Output :
		 * 1 2 3 4 5 6
		 *
		 * Click me to see the solution
		 *
		 * 11. Write a Java program to test whether a given double/float value is a finite floating-point value or not.
		 *
		 * 12. Write a Java program to compare two given signed and unsigned numbers.
		 *
		 * 13. Write a Java program to compute the floor division and the floor modulus of the given dividend and divisor.
		 *
		 * 14. Write a Java program to extract the primitive type value from a given BigInteger value. Go to the editor
		 * A primitive type is predefined by the language and is named by a reserved keyword. Primitive values do not share state with other primitive values. The eight primitive data types supported by the Java programming language are byte, short, int, long, float, double, Boolean and char.
		 * BigInteger() translates the sign-magnitude representation of a BigInteger into a BigInteger. The sign is represented as an integer signum value: -1 for negative, 0 for zero, or 1 for positive. The magnitude is a byte array in big-endian byte-order: the most significant byte is in the zeroth element. A zero-length magnitude array is permissible, and will result in a BigInteger value of 0, whether signum is -1, 0 or 1.
